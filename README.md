# Tof_material_classification

<!-- #The conventional methods of material Imaging supported by RGB cameras fail in the dense classification of look-alike
materials. To solve this problem, the MIRF(Material Impulse Response Function)-based and texture-independent complex
feature vectors was extracted for each pixel from the raw Time of Flight sensor data and a classifier was trained on this
extracted complex feature vectors using CNNâ€™s.

The matlab file provided, contains the feature vectors extraction part that is extraction of the fourier sample of Material Impulse response function.
